personal command lines files to customize

Hi,
I use this repo to keep the settings i use on linux machines, they are customization done usually to cmd line like alias, bashrc or virc scripts.
The intention is to have versions of those file so that i can import them any time for different machines where i have linux accounts.

that's it. thanks.
